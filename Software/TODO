TODO
----

• reduce memory consumption for grabbed images
• smoothen color switching (time behaviour)
• add light dynamic effects
• improve HTTP support
• daemonize this whole stuff 
• Each device should have its own set of playmodes
• create Sequence(Player|Manager) to have one thread for all registered devices
• autodetect devices on system by default
• use /var for running webserver, but populate with stuff from DATADIR
• Refactor class structure, especially DeviceMode handling
• get rid of that nasty CDevice::LEDConfigurationCallback and find a better approach
• WebCam sensor mode?
• UserMode?
• refactor code to avoid continue/break - it's nice for C, but simply overhead in C++
• split into shared library core and a small frontend tool
• build some nice python wrapper
• build Documentation
